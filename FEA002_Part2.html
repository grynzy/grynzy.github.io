										How to make cortical and cancellous bone models - PART 2: Blender</h1>
									<p>The bone model is assumed to have cortical layer with certain thickness, and cancellous layer beneath it.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>This is the second post about my working flow (or I can say my experience) in making the cortical and cancellous bones. The first part of tutorial was about preparing the two layers of bone, using software called Meshmixer. If you are interested in the way I prepared the layers, you can check my previous <a href="FEA001_Part1.html">post</a>.</p>
								<p>Rather than using Meshmixer again, I chose to use Blender software to finish up my model. You can download it for free from this <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/">link</a>.</p>
								<p>I put my arguments on fully finishing my work in Meshmixer on the last part of the first part of tutorial, too. Without further a do, here are the steps I did: </p>
								<h2>Set up the models and functions</h2>
								<p>Once you open Blender, just create new general model, and delete the cube that usually appears by default whenever you start new model. Then, import the bone model file by clicking FILE ‚Üí IMPORT ‚Üí any type of imported file. In my case, I used STL file which was exported from my first part of tutorial.</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_2.jpg"><center>Imported bone model got from the first tutorial</center></center></p>
								<p>In making the final result, I used principle of Boolean operation, where some parts are used as cutter for other parts to yield new modified part. Blender provides this function, but it may be easier to be used by open EDIT ‚Üí PREFERENCES. Then, go to ADD-ONS tab, and type ‚ÄúBool‚Äù in the search tab. The search result would look like this:</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_3.jpg"><center>Enabling the Bool Tool</center></center></p>
								<p>Once you enable it, the layout on the right side of the software would be like this:</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_4.jpg"><center>Bool Tool Enabled</center></center></p>
								<p>
									As I mentioned about Boolean, there must be a part to be the ‚Äúcutter‚Äù for other part. In my case, I used simple plane to be the cutter. I made the plane model while my layout is still in Object Mode, not Edit Mode. I hit ADD ‚Üí MESH ‚Üí PLANE. There will be a plane appearing on the center of coordinate.
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_5.jpg"></center></p>
								<p>
									I re-scaled the size of the plane as well as its position to the position where it intersected small part of the bottom part of my bone model (distal part of tibia). Indeed, the end result yield shorter bone model as the compensation of using this Boolean. You can re-scale the plane by hitting S after you click the plane. You can move the plane by the same manner but use G instead of S. In my case, after I hit G, I used Z so that the plane moved along the Z-axis.
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_6.jpg"><center>Scaling the plane</center></center></p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_7.jpg"><center>Typing G and Z to adjust the plate position</center></center></p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_8.jpg"><center>Plane adjusted</center></center></p>
								<p>
									I also separated the outer and inner bones by choosing the bone first. Then I hit TAB to change the mode into Edit Mode. With the bone being covered by orange dots (yeah there were so many dots or so-called nodes) I used left click ‚Üí SEPARATE ‚Üí BY LOOSE PARTS.
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_9.jpg"><center>Separating the bone layers</center></center></p>
								<p>
									It ended up giving me two separated bones.
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_10.jpg"></center></p>
								<p>
									As the Boolean operation would delete the original file, I suggested to have copies of each model and keeping them in new collection as ‚ÄúBackup files‚Äù.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now that the file has been imported and the tools needed has been enabled, what remained was the Boolean operation
								</p>
								<h2>Boolean Operation</h2>
								<p>
									The principle in using the BOOL TOOL is to click one part, hold SHIFT while clicking other part, and perform one of the AUTO BOOLEAN. In my case, firstly I only made the models I want to involve in as the visible ones, leaving other models being hidden. I clicked the plane first, then held SHIFT while choosing the outer bone model. You can now see that the first one being chosen had darker color.
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_11.jpg"><center>Boolean operaton for outer bone</center></center></p>
								<p>
									I opened EDIT tab at the right side of layout, expanded BOOL TOOL, and chose SLICE. The result was shown below:
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_12.jpg"><center>Result of Boolean operation</center></center></p>
								<p>
									It was not finished yet. The orange surface cultivated from the Boolean operation then was deleted, giving final result like this:
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_13.jpg"><center>Obtained outer bone model</center></center></p>
								<p>
									I would like to remind you that the plane was deleted after this process. That is where backing up other plane took its role. Same procedures were also applied to the inner bone model.
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_14.jpg"><center>Boolean operation for inner bone</center></center></p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_15.jpg"><center>Result of Boolean operation on inner bone model</center></center></p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_16.jpg"><center>Finished Boolean operation of inner bone model</center></center></p>
								<p>
									As we can see, there were some flakes of grey shade on the inner bone model because both first and second results surface collided each other. It brought me to the last step, where I firstly chose inner bone, held SHIFT while choosing the outer one, and hit the SLICE on Auto Boolean.
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_17.jpg"><center>Last Boolean operation</center></center></p>
								<p>
									The final result was eventually obtained.
								</p>
								<p><center><img src="contents/FEA002/FEA002_1.jpg"><center>Final result</center></center></p>
								<p>
									Hopefully these tutorials bring more insights to you in preparing models similar with mine. I intendedly used both free software in as I thought both software are powerful yet freely accessible for those who has not been able to afford pricier similar software. It would be advantageous instead if we can utilize the free software as optimum as we can üôÇ. Thank you and see you in the other upcoming posts!
